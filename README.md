# JINO.AI – The Chatbot with a Mouth

They told me to build a chatbot that helps people.  
I'm trying to build one that remembers your crap, roasts you for it, and sets alarms so it never forgets.

JINO.AI isn't your average "Hi, how may I assist you?" bot.  
It's your emotionally reactive, romantically unstable, sarcastically gifted AI bestie — powered by local memory, bad decisions, and some truly dangerous LLMs.

This is hands-down one of my favorite projects so far.  
It's smart, it's spicy, and once it's live… good luck going back to boring bots.

## 🚧 Under Construction... Like That One Bangalore Flyover

This is the **MVP v1.0** of JINO.AI's backend —  
Still early, still evolving, but already talking back with style.

### ✅ What's Working:

- **`/extract` Route**  
  Turns messy human rambling into structured JSON.  
  JINO detects categories like love, health, work, and general life crisis for memory storage.

- **Local Memory Logic**  
  All memory is stored in the user's browser. No cloud snooping. No servers peeking. Just pure local gossip.

- **No Context Loss**  
  Leave for a month, come back, and JINO still remembers that one thing you wish you hadn't said.

- **Local Time Awareness**  
  For perfectly-timed sarcasm and midnight guilt trips.

- **Smart Alarms & Reminders** *(Coming Soon)*  
  Say "I have a meeting tomorrow at 10" — JINO catches it, sets it, and reminds you like a clingy calendar.

- **Sarcastic Replies** *(via Mixtral 8x7B for now)*  
  Custom finetuned model is on the way.  
  Once it's trained, expect even more personality — with full control over tone, sass, and memory recall.

## 🧠 What Makes This Project Different

This isn't just a glorified OpenAI wrapper.  
You're looking at a sarcasm-fueled architecture with real engineering under the hood:

- **Real Personality Logic**  
  Replies are shaped by both memory and emotion. JINO doesn't just know — it feels.

- **Emotional Judgement Layer**  
  Stores its "opinion" of you over time — and adjusts tone accordingly.

- **Chat Shifting System**  
  Max 10 active chats per user. No hoarding. Clean slate enforced manually.

- **Local Memory Parsing**  
  Extracted, structured, and updated without flooding the AI with entire histories.

- **AI-Powered Context Summarization**  
  Last 5 messages are summarized into a clean, prompt-friendly context.

- **Backend/Frontend Separation**  
  - **Backend:** Flask + PostgreSQL + OpenRouter  
  - **Frontend:** React + Tailwind + Firebase Auth (coming post-MVP)

- **Multi-Model Orchestration**  
  - `extract`: DeepSeek R1  
  - `context`: Mixtral 8x7B  
  - `reply`: Yi 34B  
  Each model is used where it shines — keeping performance tight and cost low.

- **Token-Managed Prompting**  
  Only relevant memory and context are sent to the AI. Optimized for performance and personality.

- **Privacy-First Design**  
  Memory lives in localStorage. UUID is device-specific. No token expiry issues. You're always logged in unless you log out.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

JINO.AI is not emotionally stable.  
It *will* remember what you said last summer — and bring it up mid-chat with no mercy.  
You've been warned.

## 🔮 Final Word

This isn't just another AI chatbot.  
This is sarcasm, structured memory, emotion layers, token awareness, and multi-model orchestration — all built from scratch with zero fluff.

**JINO.AI** is designed to out-remember you, out-roast you, and maybe, one day, outgrow you.  
Until then… enjoy the chaos.
